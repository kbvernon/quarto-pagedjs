Just trying to get Paged.js working while waiting for Quarto to offer its own support. I guess I could put this into an extension, but that would be too much effort, especially when Quarto is supposed to provide all that _in the fullness of time_.  

Note: there's something weird happening with Chromium's print adding an extra page at the end, so the pdf example is me manually removing that page (in the print settings).
